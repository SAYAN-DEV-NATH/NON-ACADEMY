    <h1>About Bangladesh</h1>
    <h3>Bangladesh 2.0</h3>
    <p>"Bangladesh 2.0" refers to a period of significant political and social change in Bangladesh, largely driven by
        it youth, and characterized by a push for democracy and reforms. This movement, sometimes called the
        Students-People's
        Uprising or the July Revolution, emerged in the summer of 2024 following protests against a reinstated job quota
        system.
        The movement led to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet and the establishment of an
        interim
        government.</p>
